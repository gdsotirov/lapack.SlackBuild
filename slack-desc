lapack: LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage)
lapack:
lapack: LAPACK is written in Fortran90 and provides routines for solving
lapack: systems of simultaneous linear equations, least-squares solutions
lapack: of linear systems of equations, eigenvalue problems, and singular
lapack: value problems.  The associated matrix factorizations (LU,
lapack: Cholesky, QR, SVD, Schur, generalized Schur) are also provided,
lapack: as are related computations such as reordering of the Schur
lapack: factorizations and estimating condition numbers.  Dense and banded
lapack: matrices are handled, but not general sparse matrices.  In all
lapack: areas, similar functionality is provided for real and complex
lapack: matrices, in both single and double precision.
