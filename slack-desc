lapack: LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage)
lapack:
lapack: LAPACK is a library of Fortran subroutines for solving the most
lapack: commonly occurring problems in numerical linear algebra like solving
lapack: systems of simultaneous linear equations, least-squares solutions
lapack: of linear systems of equations, eigenvalue problems, and singular
lapack: value problems.  The associated matrix factorizations (LU,
lapack: Cholesky, QR, SVD, Schur, generalized Schur) are also provided,
lapack: as are related computations such as reordering of the Schur
lapack: factorizations and estimating condition numbers.  Dense and banded
lapack: matrices are handled, but not general sparse matrices.  In all
lapack: areas, similar functionality is provided for real and complex
lapack: matrices, in both single and double precision.
lapack: The package contains also the Fortran subroutines of the Basic Linear
lapack: Algebra Subprograms (the Level 1, 2, and 3 BLAS), CBLAS, a C interface
lapack: to the BLAS, and LAPACKE, a C interface to LAPACK.
